# EC503_Proj
Final Project
We have conducted a comparitive study on four different types of clustering algorithms, namely:
- Gaussian Mixture Model
- Density-Based Spatial Clustering with Noise Application
- Spectral Clustering
- Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies.

The datasets chosen are:
- Fraud Bank Transactions
- Expedia Travel

Toy datasets include:
- Noisy circles
- Blobs
- Varied Variances
- Lattice

The datasets so chosen bring out the vital variations in these different models and showcase proper use case for each algorithm.
